ABSTRACT = {This work thoroughly compares the efficiency of Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks as models of the dynamical processes used in Model Predictive Control (MPC). Two simulated industrial processes were considered: a polymerisation reactor and a neutralisation (pH) process. First, MPC prediction equations for both types of models were derived. Next, the efficiency of the LSTM and GRU models was compared for a number of model configurations. The influence of the order of dynamics and the number of neurons on the model accuracy was analysed. Finally, the efficiency of the considered models when used in MPC was assessed. The influence of the model structure on different control quality indicators and the calculation time was discussed. It was found that the GRU network, although it had a lower number of parameters than the LSTM one, may be successfully used in MPC without any significant deterioration of control quality.},
